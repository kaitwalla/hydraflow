"""Shared conflict resolution prompt builder for HydraFlow.

Used by both :mod:`pr_unsticker` and :mod:`review_phase` to produce
a concise prompt that points the conflict-resolution agent at the
relevant issue and PR URLs.  The agent has full filesystem access
(CLAUDE.md, .claude/ memory, git history) and can pull whatever
additional context it needs via ``gh`` CLI.
