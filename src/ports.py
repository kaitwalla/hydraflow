"""Hexagonal architecture port interfaces for HydraFlow.

Defines the formal boundaries between domain logic (phases, runners) and
infrastructure (GitHub API, git CLI, agent subprocesses).

## Port map

::

    Domain (phases)
        │
        ├─► TaskFetcher / TaskTransitioner (task_source.py — already formal)
        ├─► PRPort                          (GitHub PR / label / CI operations)
        └─► WorkspacePort                   (git workspace lifecycle)

Concrete adapters:
  - PRPort      → pr_manager.PRManager
  - WorkspacePort → workspace.WorkspaceManager

Both concrete classes satisfy their respective protocols via structural
subtyping (typing.runtime_checkable).  No changes to the concrete classes
are required.

Usage in tests — replace concrete classes with AsyncMock / stub::

    from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
    from ports import PRPort

    prs: PRPort = AsyncMock(spec=PRPort)  # type: ignore[assignment]

IMPORTANT: All method signatures here are kept in sync with the concrete
implementations.  If a signature drifts, ``tests/test_ports.py`` will catch
it via ``inspect.signature`` comparison.
