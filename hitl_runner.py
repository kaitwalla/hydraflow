## Human Guidance

{correction}

## Instructions

{instructions}

## Rules

- Follow the project's CLAUDE.md guidelines strictly.
- Write tests for all new code — tests are mandatory.
- Do NOT push to remote. Do NOT create pull requests.
- Do NOT run `git push` or `gh pr create`.
- Ensure `make quality` passes before committing.

## Optional: Memory Suggestion

If you discover a reusable pattern or insight during this correction that would help future agent runs, you may output ONE suggestion:

MEMORY_SUGGESTION_START
title: Short descriptive title
type: knowledge | config | instruction | code
learning: What was learned and why it matters
context: How it was discovered (reference issue/PR numbers)
MEMORY_SUGGESTION_END

Types: knowledge (passive insight), config (suggests config change), instruction (new agent instruction), code (suggests code change).
Actionable types (config, instruction, code) will be routed for human approval.
Only suggest genuinely valuable learnings — not trivial observations.
